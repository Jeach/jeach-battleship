# Jeach Battleship

## Introduction

This game is intended to be a simple multi-player battleship game which can also be played against the computer.

Both my sons, at the early age of 4 and 5, loved the game of battleship. But lacking the capability and understanding of the coordinate system (ie: A3, B7, etc.), it was almost impossible for them to play. This game is intended to solve this problem.

## Timeline

Created project on December 30th, 2024, and will be committing periodically until a core game has been created. Intend to add features with time.
