Essence of the MIT License

The MIT License is a permissive open-source software license that is simple and
developer-friendly. Its essence lies in granting users broad freedoms while
imposing minimal obligations.

Below is an overview of the rights and obligations associated with the
MIT License:

1. Rights Granted by the MIT License

   a) Freedom to Use - You can use the licensed software for any purpose,
   including commercial, educational, or private use.

   b) Freedom to Copy - You are allowed to copy and redistribute the
   software in its original form or modified versions.

   c) Freedom to Modify - You can alter the software to suit your needs, fix
   bugs, or enhance its functionality.

   d) Freedom to Distribute - You can distribute the original or modified
   versions of the software, either free of charge or for a fee.

2. Obligations Under the MIT License

   a) Include the License - You must include a copy of the original License
   text (this file) in any distributed copy of the software, whether original
   or modified.

   b) Maintain Copyright Notice - The copyright notice of the original
   author(s) must remain intact in the source code or any distribution of the
   software.

   c) No Warranty - The license explicitly states that the software is
   provided "as-is" without any warranty, and the authors are not liable for
   any damages that may arise from using the software.

3. Key Features of the MIT License

   a) Minimal Restrictions - Unlike more restrictive licenses (ie: GPL), the
   MIT License does not require derivative works or modifications to be
   licensed under the same terms.

   b) Flexibility - It allows for integration into proprietary projects, making
   it widely used in both open-source and commercial software development.
